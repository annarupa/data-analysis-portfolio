# Data Analysis Portfolio – Anna Rupa Anthony

Data Analyst | Business Intelligence | Systems Analyst

About Me
I'm a Data Analyst and Business Intelligence professional with experience delivering data-driven insights across financial services and healthcare domains. I specialize in translating complex data into clear, actionable intelligence — building BI dashboards, designing data quality frameworks, and working as a systems analyst to improve how data flows through enterprise applications.
I care about getting data right. That means not just finding errors, but tracing them back through end-to-end data flows, understanding why they happen, and proposing systematic solutions that prevent recurrence.

What I Work With
SQLMicrosoft SQL Server, Snowflake, Databricks,Tableau, Tableau Data Prep, Power BI, DAX,Data Quality, Reconciliation, Root-Cause Analysis, Data Governance,Jira, ServiceNow, SharePoint

What's in This Repository
This portfolio contains real-world style scripts and queries built from patterns in my production support work:

🔍 Root-cause investigation — SQL queries that trace data discrepancies through upstream systems
✅ Data quality checks — reusable validation rules for nulls, duplicates, referential integrity, and volume anomalies
🔄 Reconciliation reports — source-to-target matching with break analysis and audit logging
🐍 Python analysis — automated data profiling and anomaly detection across financial and healthcare datasets
📊 Tableau prep queries — optimized SQL extracts with date dimensions and KPIs ready for dashboard consumption
